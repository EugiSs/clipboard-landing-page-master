# clipboard-landing-page-master

Used: html, SCSS, FlexBox, Grid and mobile-first adaptive.

I think that there is probably a lot of code in the project and it was possible to somehow shorten it. 
I used paddings and margins for many elements on the mobile version and reassigned them for the computer version. Perhaps there are ways to shorten this.

I wanted to do everything as much as possible in accordance with the layout, but I ran into difficulties when placing the footer elements. 
So I used quite a lot of qualifying values, including large margins for nav.
